## Built With
- Designed in Figma
- Next.js 13
- Typescript
- React
- Tailwind CSS

## Introduction
Resources like Assist.org and CVC.edu are great for aspiring transfer students, but they're not design with university students in mind; these tools are "one-directional". GE-Z solves this problem by sourcing our data directly from them, processing it and presenting it for University Students who want to take online, articulatable courses at California Community Colleges!

Whether it's for personal, academic, or financial goals, students want to find the right CC course for them — GE-Z makes that process simple and straightforward!

## Features
- Find courses eligible for instant enrollment
- Responsiveness across mobile and desktop devices
- Sort courses by units, tuition, timeframe, and more!
