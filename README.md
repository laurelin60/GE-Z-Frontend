## About

GE-Z is the first tool of its kind for finding high-quality, articulatable courses at California Community Colleges (
CCC) that any Californian university student can take to advance their academic goals.

Resources like Assist.org and CVC.edu are great for aspiring transfer students, but they're not designed with university
students in mind; these tools are "one-directional": community colleges ‚û°Ô∏è universities. GE-Z solves this problem by
sourcing our data directly from Assist and CVC and reversing it to make finding CCC courses simple and straightforward
for university students.

### Currently Supports:

* UCI ‚úÖ
* UCSB ‚úÖ

### In the Works:

* All UCs and CSUs
* Dark Mode üêô

## Features

* Search across universities and general education requirements
* Find courses eligible for instant enrollment, zero textbook fees, and more
* Sort courses by units, tuition, timeframe, and more!
